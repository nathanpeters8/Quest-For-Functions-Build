Known Bugs and Unfinished Mechanics:
- Game loop can be thrown off pretty easily by triggering things too early

- Sometimes when player answers question incorrectly the "question skeleton" disappears
- Fighting mechanics/animations for player and enemies are pretty underdeveloped
- Can't access information in notes again after player initially picks them up
